# Double-landing-page

[Live site](https://aneal07.github.io/Double-landing-page/)

This repository contains the code for a double landing page showcasing two products or brands. It is a simple yet interactive design where the landing page adjusts based on the side you are hovering over.

## Project Structure

This project is primarily built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The layout of the webpage consists of a split view, each half dedicated to a different brand or product. The webpage dynamically adjusts the amount of space dedicated to each half based on where the user is hovering.
